I am a Masters student pursuing Robotics Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park. Currently, I am employed as a Computer Vision Engineer Intern at [Lucid VR. Inc.](https://lucidinside.com/) under the mentorship of Dr. Adam Rowell. Previously, I was a member of [Perception and Robotics Group (PRG)](http://prg.cs.umd.edu/) under the guidance of Professor [Yiannis Aloimonos](http://legacydirs.umiacs.umd.edu/~yiannis/) and Dr. [Cornelia Fermüller](http://legacydirs.umiacs.umd.edu/~fer/). 

My research interests are Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Robotics. I am curently working on various approaches to generating depth and disparity maps.
