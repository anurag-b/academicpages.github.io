I am a Masters student pursuing Robotics Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park. I am a member of [Perception and Robotics Group (PRG)](http://prg.cs.umd.edu/) under the guidance of Professor [Yiannis Aloimonos](http://legacydirs.umiacs.umd.edu/~yiannis/) and Dr. [Cornelia Fermüller](http://legacydirs.umiacs.umd.edu/~fer/). 

My research interests are Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Robotics. I am curently working on autonomous landing and takeoff of a Quadracopter for search and rescue operations.
